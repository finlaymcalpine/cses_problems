# cses_problems

A selection of problems from [[https://cses.fi/problemset/]] for the purpose of investigating features of Rust.

Not intended to be solved in a competitive programming style (e.g. will often comment and will try to refactor with better error handling). But trying to limit external crates
and to be as performant as possible.
